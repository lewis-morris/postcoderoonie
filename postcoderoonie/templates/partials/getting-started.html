        <h2>Data coverage</h2>
        <p>
            Due to source limitations, some data may be incorrect or missing. This resource cannot be relied upon and must be
            treated as inaccurate (although we believe it to be good). This service is provided "as is" and we cannot accept any liability for any misinformation provided by the API.

        <hr>
        <h2>Response times</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the large amount of records in the database & the cheap server this is running on, some calls, especially larger lists of results may take some
            time to return.
